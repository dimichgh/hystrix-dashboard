### Install

```bash
npm install hystrix-dashboard -S
```

### Usage

Expose it as part of your express app under /hystrix

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const dashboard = require('hystrix-dashboard');

app.use(dashboard({
    topic: 'hystrix:metrics' // <<< configurable hystrix metrics topic.
}));

app.listen(8000); //  http://localhost:8080/hystrix
```

The stream will can be served by /hystrix.stream if this module is used within the same runtime where service metrics is generated.

The stream will listen on process events with the configured topic (by default it will use 'hystrix:metrics')

Here's an example how you can link dashboard to the real metrics for services based on [hystrixjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hystrixjs) module:

```js
const hystrixStream = require('hystrixjs').hystrixSSEStream;

hystrixStream.toObservable().subscribe(
    // publish metrics under hystrix:metrics
    sseData => process.emit('hystrix:metrics', sseData),
    err => {},
    () => {}
);
```

For a real example, you can look at how [trooba-hystrix-handler](https://github.com/trooba/trooba-hystrix-handler) uses it to expose trooba pipeline service metrics.
